# retrying-promise

> Create fault tolerant promises that retry upon failure according to an exponential and/or custom retry strategy.

The implementation of the retry strategies reuses code from the [node-retry][] project.


## Usage

Install `retrying-promise`:

```shell
npm install retrying-promise
```

Import `retrying-promise`:

    const retryPromise = require('retrying-promise');

The constant `retryPromise` is a function that returns a promise. Use this function similar to how you call the `new Promise()` constructor, but pass it a function that takes three instead of two functions as arguments: `resolve`, `retry` and `reject`.

    var promise = retryPromise(function (resolve, retry, reject) {

        resolve(result);  // the promise resolves normally

        retry(error);     // the promise failed and a retry may be attempted

        reject(error);    // the promise failed and no retry should be attempted

    });

Call the `resolve` function when the promise resolves normally.

Call the `retry` function when the promise failed and a retry may be attempted.

Call the `reject` function when the promise failed and no retry should be attempted.



## Test

Install [Mocha][].

```shell
sudo npm install -g mocha
```

Run tests:

```shell
npm test
```
